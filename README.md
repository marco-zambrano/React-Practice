# Follow Card Component for X - React Practice 🐥

This project is a React practice where I built a **Follow Card** component similar to the one from **X** (formerly known as Twitter).

## Technologies Used ⚙️

- **React**: For building the interactive component.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for React projects.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.

## Development Process 🛠️

1. **Vite and React Setup**:  
   I used **Vite** as the build tool to quickly set up the React project. The initial setup was done with the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest follow-card --template react
   cd follow-card
   npm install
